Rainbeard Style Guidelines
==========================

Rainbeard aims to exhibit a uniform style, and a high value is placed on
maintaining the consistency, readability, and quality of the code. Code review
should aim to enforce these guidelines.

The foundation of Rainbeard style is the commonly accepted Python style
described in PEP 8 (and, consequently, PEP 257):
* http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

The test suite runs a PEP 8 validator over the entire source tree, which
enforces (a reasonable subset of) the PEP 8 style guidelines. Occasionally,
exceptions are somewhat warranted and it's an inconvenience to make the
validator happy. But thus far, the validator has behaved quite reasonably, and
we haven't found a compelling enough reason to turn it off. 99% of what it
finds are things that should be fixed!

We make the following exceptions to the PEP guidelines:
* Method docstrings are written with a descriptive voice rather than an active
  voice. For example, the docstring for a method called create_foo() would be
  "Creates a Foo" rather than "Create a foo". This exception is also enforced
  within the Django codebase, and makes sense from a conceptual standpoint.
  All other comments should be written in an active voice.

Comments:
* Comments are capitalized and end with a period. This applies to phrases as
  well as completele sentences. Label-style comments (one or two words) can
  be an exception to this rule, but should be used sparingly.
* Comments should be written in the active voice ("Add a" rather than "Adds a").
* Comments should be preceded by a blank line.

Misc:
* Single-line docstrings should be followed by an empty line. Multi-line
  docstrings end with the """ on a separate line, and are not followed by an
  empty line unless the subsequent line is a comment (in which case the need
  for a blank line preceding a comment applies).
* In non-code context, "Rainbeard' should always be capitalized.
* Strings designed for human consumption, such as error messages and field
  descriptions, should be enclosed in double quotes (""). All other strings
  should be enclosed in single quotes ('').
