Rainbeard Style Guidelines
==========================

Rainbeard aims to exhibit a uniform style, and a high value is placed on
maintaining the consistency, readability, and quality of the code. Code review
should aim to enforce these guidelines.

The foundation of Rainbeard style is the commonly accepted Python style
described in PEP 8 (and, consequently, PEP 257):
* http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

We make the following exceptions to the PEP guidelines:
* Method docstrings are written with a descriptive voice rather than an active
  voice. For example, the docstring for a method called create_foo() would be
  "Creates a Foo" rather than "Create a foo". This exception is also enforced
  within the Django codebase, and makes sense from a conceptual standpoint.
  All other comments should be written in an active voice.

Comments:
* Comments are capitalized and end with a period. This applies to phrases as
  well as completele sentences. Label-style comments (one or two words) can
  be an exception to this rule, but should be used sparingly.
* Comments should be written in the active voice ("Add a" rather than "Adds a").
* Comments should be preceded by a blank line.

Misc:
* Single-line docstrings should be followed by an empty line. Multi-line
  docstrings end with the """ on a separate line, and are not followed by an
  empty line unless the subsequent line is a comment (in which case the need
  for a blank line preceding a comment applies).
